Indian-Tribal-Languages-Audio-Transcription.
This project is a multi-language transcription tool built using OpenAI's Whisper model. It supports Indian and tribal languages for speech-to-text conversion and provides transcription in both native script and Roman script.

The tool utilizes Gradio for an easy-to-use web interface and supports real-time audio waveform visualization, automatic language detection, and file downloads for transcriptions.
